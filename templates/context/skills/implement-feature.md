# Skill: Implement Feature

When planning a new feature implementation, produce an execution plan that includes:

1. **Files to create or modify** — list exact paths, no ambiguity
2. **Data model changes** — if any, describe schema changes first
3. **API/interface changes** — describe new endpoints or function signatures
4. **Implementation steps** — ordered list the agent can follow sequentially
5. **Tests to write** — describe exactly what to test and where test files go
6. **Edge cases to handle** — list them explicitly so the agent doesn't miss them

Keep the plan tight. The coding agent has no business context — every instruction must be self-contained.
